This repository is dedicated to my Java learning journey — covering classwork, practice problems, and small projects done for university.

Learning Java helps build strong programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

### 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen object-oriented programming concepts  
- Practice input/output, conditionals, loops, arrays, classes, etc.  
- Build small Java-based projects to apply what I learn  
- Maintain a consistent habit of learning and coding in Java  

### 🛠 Setup

- Java Version: OpenJDK 17+  
- IDE: Zed / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  
- Compile and Run:
  ```bash
  javac FileName.java
  java FileName


Thanks for stopping by! If you're on your own Java journey too — best of luck, and keep coding. 💻☕
